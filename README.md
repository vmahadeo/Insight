### This is the readme file for my Insight project in Fall 2018, C session.

#### TODO
Make the app2.py file more modular and increase commenting.
--Include the launch of the mongo database in a function
--Create TFIDF vectors as a preprocessing step.

This project was completed over the course of two and half weeks, and as such, the coding style and readability is not up to production level standards.  Here is a brief description of the files:

app2.py is the file that runs the entire app in DASH, hosted on AWS
clean_ted_youtube.py is a script that cleans the ted talk transcript data
youtube_videos.py is a helper script to fetch youtube videos using the youtube API
