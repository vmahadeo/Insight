### This is the readme file for my Insight project in Fall 2018, C session.

This project was completed over the course of two and half weeks, and as such, the coding style and readability is not up to production level standards.  Here is a brief description of the files:

app2.py is the file that runs the entire app in DASH, hosted on AWS
clean_ted_youtube.py is a script that cleans the ted talk transcript data
youtube_videos.py is a helper script to fetch youtube videos using the youtube API
